History of Project:

-Version 1.0 (progressed to 1.1):
A scary mystic scene which focuses on a protagonist trapped in a mystery hut. The goal for the main character is to find the main door key in order to escape from the hunted hut. There is not much time left as the antagonist is about to come back and when he comes your time is over! In order to survive, first the protagonist needs to find a source of light in order to observe their surroundings. After capturing the light, the new goal would be to find the mystery book to find more information about the antagonist. To be continuedâ€¦

-Version 1.1 (Implemented):
After working on the project for a while, we decided to eliminate the farm house idea and focus on the maze dungeon. Player starts at the start point and need to find a couple of items, scattered around the maze, in order to win this level. 

-Version 1.2 (Implemented):
There is no lighting source in the maze, the player has a flashlight that only covers a limited range. There are five items around the maze which need to be collected in order to win this level.

-Version 1.3 (Implemented):
We decided to use hidden objects for the player to collide with in order to keep track of which locations the player has visited. In addition, when the level is completed, the roof will be moved in order to show the player completed the challenge and now they can wander around the map with enough visibility. 

-Current is Final Build.
